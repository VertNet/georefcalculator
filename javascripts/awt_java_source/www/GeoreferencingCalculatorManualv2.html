Suppose also that you&#39;ve obtained the coordinates for Bakersfield (35&deg; 22&#39; 24&quot; N, 119&deg; 1&#39; 4&quot; W) by determining the center of town to the nearest second from the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map. To learn how to coordinates using offsets from a location with known coordinates, see the section </span><span class="c1">Calculating Coordinates Only</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>To begin, select &quot;USGS map: 1:24,000&quot; from the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate Source</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list. Next, select &ldquo;degrees minutes seconds&rdquo; from the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate System</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list, then enter the coordinates for Bakersfield in the </span><span class="c1">Latitude</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1">Longitude</span><span>&nbsp;fields that appear. Make certain to select the correct cardinal directions from the drop-down lists to the right of each coordinate field.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span>&nbsp;For this example, the coordinate system &lsquo;degrees minutes seconds&rdquo; was selected because the map showed coordinates in degrees minutes seconds, thus the coordinates determined for the center of Bakersfield were described in the same way. In some cases, coordinates on a map, or other resource, may be represented in degrees decimal minutes, such as 35&deg; 22&rsquo; N, 119&deg; 0&rsquo; W or 35&deg; 22.4&rsquo; N, 119&deg; 1.066667&rsquo; W. Coordinates also may be presented in decimal degrees, such as 35.3733333, -119.0177778. The coordinate system selected in the calculator must reflect the coordinate system used on the map or other resource.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>The Gosford Quad map uses the North American 1927 horizontal datum, so select &quot;(NAD27) North American 1927&quot; from the </span><span class="c1">Datum</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list. In most cases you can find the datum printed on the bottom of the map. Sometimes an ellipsoid is listed on the map instead of a datum. The calculator also includes ellipsoids in the </span><span class="c1">Datum</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list. If you find a resource such as a map with a datum that in not listed in the Calculator, try to find the ellipsoid for that datum using online resources, then select the ellipsoid in the </span><span class="c1">Datum</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list. </span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>The coordinates in this example have been specified to the nearest second, so select &quot;nearest second&quot; from the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate Precision</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list. The direction given in the locality description is E (east), so select &ldquo;E&rdquo; in the </span><span class="c1">Direction</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list. The offset distance is 10 mi (miles), so type &quot;10&quot; into the </span><span class="c1">Offset Distance</span><span>&nbsp;text box.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Bakersfield is quite a big place and we don&#39;t know if the original locality meant 10 miles from the center of town or 10 miles from the city limit (or something else entirely), so, given that it is 3 miles from the specified coordinates to the east edge of town (as measured on the map), the </span><span class="c1">Extent of Named Place</span><span>&nbsp;should be 3 miles. Enter &quot;3&quot; into the </span><span class="c1">Extent of Named Place</span><span>&nbsp;text field.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span>&nbsp;If you had measured this distance in kilometers you can convert kilometers to miles using the </span><span class="c1">Distance Converter</span><span>&nbsp;at the bottom of the calculator and enter the converted number into the appropriate field (see the </span><span class="c1">Distance and Scale Converters</span><span>&nbsp;section to learn how to use the converters). </span><span class="c9">All distance measurements must be in the same system as the locality description for the calculator to return proper results</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>The determination of the coordinates for Bakersfield is only as accurate as the tools the georeferencer used; the map, the size of the units on the measurement tool, and the georeferencer&rsquo;s ability to discern their placement relative to items on the map. Any error associated with the map itself is accounted for in the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate Source</span><span>&nbsp;selection. Error associated with the georeferencer&rsquo;s ability to measure on the map is accounted for in the </span><span class="c1">Measurement Error</span><span>&nbsp;field.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>To complete the </span><span class="c1">Measurement Error</span><span>&nbsp;field, you must first determine (or estimate) the smallest distance that you can reliably (repeatably) measure on the map. Generally, people can distinguish features or locations to within about one (1) millimeter, given a ruler with millimeter divisions. If you use a ruler with English units, you may be able to distinguish to 1/16 of an inch. The quality of your measuring tool, eyesight, and technique may alter these suggested values.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Once you have determined your smallest distance at which you can measure consistently and correctly, enter that value and the units into the </span><span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span>&nbsp;at the bottom of the calculator, select the scale of the map on which you made your measurement, and then select the unit of measure into which you want to convert. For example, if you used a digital measuring tool that was able to measure to the nearest 0.1 mm on a 1:24000 map and you need to convert to miles, enter 0.1 into the </span><span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span>, then select &ldquo;mm&rdquo; from the units drop-down list. Next, choose the &ldquo;1:24000&rdquo; scale option in the map scale drop-down list. Finally, select &ldquo;mi&rdquo; in the second drop-down list. Your answer to 0.1 mm at 1:24000 converted into miles will be displayed in blue (0.00149 mi). You can then type &ldquo;0.00149&rdquo; into the </span><span class="c1">Measurement Error </span><span>field, or move it from the </span><span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span>&nbsp;using cut and paste keyboard combinations.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Next, make certain that &quot;mi&quot; is selected in the </span><span class="c1">Distance Units</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list, since the locality is described in miles (&ldquo;10 mi E...&rdquo;). The distance component in this locality is 10 mi, which is precise to the nearest mile (see the discussion on this topic in the </span><span class="c1">Georeferencing Guidelines</span><span>). Select &quot;1 mi&quot; in the </span><span class="c1">Distance Precisio</span><span>n drop-down list. Now that all of the parameters for this locality have been entered, your calculator should appear as in Figure 5, below.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><img height="481" src="images/image09.png" width="622"></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Figure 5.

If the locality type is the same as for the previously georeferenced locality it is not necessary to select the locality type again.

For, example, to georeference the locality &quot;10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield,&quot; it is necessary to determine the coordinates for &ldquo;Bakersfield&rdquo; before the whole locality can be georeferenced. Suppose your coordinate source is the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map. Once you have determined the point on the map you believe to be the center of Bakersfield, find a convenient point on the map having known coordinates, such as the nearest corner of the map. In this case, the northeast corner of the map is closest and marked with the known coordinates 35&deg; 22&rdquo; 30&rdquo; N, 119&deg; 00&rsquo; W.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>To begin the calculation, select &ldquo;Coordinates only&rdquo; (because you only want to find the coordinates of the center of Bakersfield) as your </span><span class="c1">Calculation Type</span><span>&nbsp;and &ldquo;Distance along orthogonal directions&rdquo; as your </span><span class="c1">Locality Type</span><span>&nbsp;(because you are going to measure south and west from the corner of the map the the center of Bakersfield). Next, select &ldquo;USGS map: 1:24,000&rdquo; as your </span><span class="c1">Coordinate Source</span><span>&nbsp;and &ldquo;degrees minutes seconds&rdquo; as your </span><span class="c1">Coordinate System</span><span>. Enter the coordinates of the known point (the corner of the map, in this example) into the </span><span class="c1">Latitude</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1">Longitude</span><span>&nbsp;fields (35&deg; 22&rdquo; 30&rdquo; N, 119&deg; 00&rsquo; W - don&rsquo;t neglect the cardinal directions for the correct hemisphere). Finally, select &ldquo;(NAD27) North American 1927&rdquo; as your datum.

Calculator fields completed with known parameters for &ldquo;Coordinates only&rdquo; calculation type.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>Now use your measuring tool to measure a) the distance between the northeast corner of the map and the line of latitude of the center of Bakersfield where it meets the east edge of the map, and b) the distance between the northeast corner of the map and the line of longitude of the center of Bakersfield where it meets the north edge of the map. These are your orthogonal distances to the S and W of the known point, the northeast corner of the map.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span>&nbsp;You will have to convert the measurements you make on the maps (mm, cm, or inches) into the distance unit provided in the locality (miles, in this example). You can use the </span><span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span>, at the bottom of the Calculator, to do this calculation (see the section entitled </span><span class="c1">Distance and Scale Converters</span><span>). The accuracy of your measurements is determined by the size of the units marked on your measurement tool and your ability to discern their placement relative to items on the map, thus, final coordinates may vary depending upon the units you can measure. This uncertainty is addressed by the </span><span class="c1">Measurement Error</span><span>&nbsp;field in the &ldquo;Coordinates and error&rdquo; and &ldquo;Error only&rdquo; calculation types and will included in future steps in the georeferencing process.</span></p><p class="c2"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span>The point we have determined to be the center of Bakersfield is 7.71 mm south of the 35&deg; N line of latitude and 67.31 mm west of the 119&deg; W line of longitude. After you have used the </span><span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span>&nbsp;to convert millimeters to miles, cut and paste the values for miles into the Offset Distance boxes on the right side of the calculator: 0.11498 should be pasted or typed into the </span><span class="c1">North or South Offset Distance</span><span>&nbsp;field, and the cardinal direction drop-down list should be set to &ldquo;S&rdquo; (south); 1.00379 should be pasted or typed into the </span><span class="c1">East or West Offset Distance</span><span>&nbsp;field, and the cardinal direction drop-down list should be set to &ldquo;W&rdquo; (west). The </span><span class="c1">Distance Units</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down list should display &ldquo;mi,&rdquo; for miles, since that is the unit described in the locality.

Example: finding the coordinates of a named place based on the distances to coordinates labeled at the corner of a map.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Error Only </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Used to determine the error when the final coordinates for a locality description are already known. This is necessarily the case for the following Locality Types: Coordinates Only, Named Place Only, Distance Only, and Distance Along Path.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Coordinate Precision </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The category of precision with which a set of coordinates has been specified in their source. The set of possible values for precision is based on the coordinate system. A value of &ldquo;exact&rdquo; is any level of precision higher than the otherwise highest precision given on a list. Sources may include paper or digital maps, digital imagery, GPS&rsquo;s, gazetteers, or locality descriptions. Examples: 35 22&rsquo; 24&rdquo; = nearest second.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Coordinate Source </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The tool or other resources (map, GPS, gazetteer, locality description) from which the coordinates were derived.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Coordinate System </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Defines the original geographic coordinate system (decimal degrees, degrees minutes seconds, degrees decimal minutes) of the coordinate source. Selecting the original coordinate system allows the coordinates to be entered in their native format and forces the calculator to present appropriate values for coordinate precision.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Datum (Geodetic Datum) </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Defines the position of the origin and orientation of an ellipsoid upon which the coordinates are based for the given Coordinate Source. The Calculator includes ellipsoids on the drop-down list of Datums, as sometimes that is all that coordinate source shows. Examples: WGS84, NAD27</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ellipsoid </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The shape and size of a 3-dimensional model of the earth.

Enter the heading (bearing; 0 is north, 90 is east, etc.) from the named place as given in the locality description. Example: &ldquo;7 miles at 122&deg; from mouth of Sacramento River&rdquo; Note: if the bearing is given toward the named place instead of from it, enter the bearing 180 degrees away from the given bearing. Example: &ldquo;1.5 km 262 degrees to Whale Rock,&rdquo; for which you should enter &ldquo;82&rdquo; into the empty field.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Distance Converter </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; A set of controls at the bottom of the Calculator comprising a tool designed to convert measurements from one unit of length into another.

Use the original units as given in the description in order to configure the calculator to make the appropriate measurements and errors. Examples: select &ldquo;mi&rdquo; for &quot;10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield,&quot; select &ldquo;km&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.2 km SE of Lisbon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Extent of Named Place </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The distance from the geographic center to the furthest point of the geographic area covered by a named place or feature. Types of named places include urban areas, small/mid-sized towns, remote locations, street addresses, junctions and crossings, and traditional and non-traditional features (lakes, mountains, cultural lands, reservations, parks, and other geographic entities).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">GPS Accuracy </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; When &ldquo;GPS&rdquo; is selected as the Coordinate Source, the label for the </span><span class="c1">Measurement Error</span><span>&nbsp;text box changes to &ldquo;GPS Accuracy&rdquo;. Enter the value given by the GPS at the time the coordinates were captured, or 30m for open areas after 1 May 2000 when Selective Availability was discontinued, or 100m in for other conditions.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Languages </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Calculator may be used in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Dutch. The language can be changed using the language drop-down list in the upper left-hand corner of the Calculator. The English option has two variants with subtle differences. &ldquo;English&rdquo; will present the Calculator and all labels and formatting in English. &ldquo;English (local)&rdquo; will present the Calculator in the English language while retaining the Locale settings of the computer on which it is run. Thus, a computer configured for a French Locale will require and display numbers using commas as the decimal separator. Selecting &ldquo;English&rdquo; in the drop-down language list will force the calculator to use the period as the decimal separator. All other language selections not only change the language, but also change the number formatting to match. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Latitude </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The angle north or south of the equator (latitude 0). Latitudes north of the equator are positive by convention, while latitudes to the south are negative.The Calculator supports degree-based coordinate systems for latitude and longitude: degrees minutes seconds (35&deg; 22&rsquo; 24&rdquo; N), decimal degrees (35.3733333), and degrees decimal minutes (35&deg; 22.4 N). </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Locality Type </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The pattern of the most specific part of a locality description to be georeferenced. There are six variations that the Calculator can compute: Coordinates only, Distance along a path, Distance along orthogonal directions, Distance at a heading, Distance only, and Named place only.

Used when the calculated coordinates represent the coordinates of a named place in locality description. Example: Using the &ldquo;Coordinates only&rdquo; calculation type, the coordinates for the named place &ldquo;Tiny Town&rdquo; are calculated. These coordinates, presented in the &ldquo;results&rdquo; fields, can be promoted up into the Latitude and Longitude fields to georeference the locality description &ldquo;3 km SE Tiny Town&rdquo; using the &ldquo;Coordinates and error&rdquo; calculation type.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Scale Converter </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; A set of controls at the bottom of the Calculator comprising a tool designed to convert units of measure from a given map scale into units in real world distances.

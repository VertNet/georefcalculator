<p class="c7">
<span class="c16">T</span><span>he Georeferencing Calculator described in this document 
is a javascript application created as a tool to aid in the georeferencing of descriptive 
localities such as those found in museum-based natural history collections. It was 
originally designed for the Mammal Networked Information System (MaNIS) and has been 
widely adopted in other large-scale collaborative georeferencing projects to supplement 
semi-automated georeferencing tools such as BioGeomancer and GeoLocate. The application 
makes calculations using the methods described in the MaNIS/HerpNET/ORNIS </span>
<span class="c5">
<a class="c6" href="./GeorefGuide.html">
Georeferencing Guidelines</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>It will be useful to run the calculator while reviewing this 
document; to do so, either download the stand-alone version of the calculator </span>
<span class="c5"><a class="c6" href="http://manisnet.org/gci2.zip">
(http://manisnet.org/gci2.zip)</a></span><span> or use the online version at </span>
<span class="c5"><a class="c6" href="http://manisnet.org/gci2.html">
http://manisnet.org/gci2.html</a></span><span>. When the application is finished loading, 
it should more or less as in Figure 1, below.</span></p>

first opens.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>The calculator is designed to show the user only what is needed to 
proceed from one step to the next in the georeferencing process. The general work 
flow is:</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Step 1: Select the type of calculation you want to perform.</span>
</p>
<p class="c7"><span>Step 2: Select the type of locality best matches the one you 
want to georeference.</span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Step 3: Enter all of the parameters needed to make the calculation. 
The calculator will show text and selection boxes for values that are needed for 
the calculation.</span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Step 4: Calculate.</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Select the calculation type you want 
to perform. If you want to figure out coordinates and errors based on a named place and 
offsets, select the "Coordinates and error" option. If you already have the coordinates 
for the final location and you only want to calculate the error, select the "Error only" 
option. If you need to determine the coordinates of a named place based on known 
reference coordinates, such as from the corner of a map, select the “Coordinates only” 
option.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7">
<span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span> Selecting the "Error only" option, the 
calculator will always return the decimal latitude and longitude equivalent of the 
coordinates entered manually into the </span><span class="c1">Latitude</span>
<span> and </span><span class="c1">Longitude</span><span> fields. When using 
the "Coordinates and Errors" or “Coordinates only” options the calculator will always 
return decimal latitude and longitude different from those entered, because the locality 
description will have one or more offsets from those coordinates.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span>Figure 4. Parameters relevant to georeferencing a locality containing 
a distance at a heading.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c1">Example</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Suppose the locality you are trying to georeference is "10 mi E 
(by air) Bakersfield" as shown as the example in selection box for the "Distance at a 
heading" locality type. Suppose also that you've obtained the coordinates for Bakersfield 
(35° 22' 24" N, 119° 1' 4" W) by determining the center of town to the nearest second 
from the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map. To learn how to coordinates using offsets from a 
location with known coordinates, see the section </span><span class="c1">Calculating 
Coordinates Only</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To begin, select "USGS map: 1:24,000" from the </span>
<span class="c1">Coordinate Source</span><span> drop-down list. Next, select 
“degrees minutes seconds” from the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate System</span>
<span> drop-down list, then enter the coordinates for Bakersfield in the </span>
<span class="c1">Latitude</span><span> and </span><span class="c1">Longitude</span>
<span> fields that appear. Make certain to select the correct cardinal directions 
from the drop-down lists to the right of each coordinate field.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span> For this example, the coordinate 
system ‘degrees minutes seconds” was selected because the map showed coordinates in 
degrees minutes seconds, thus the coordinates determined for the center of Bakersfield 
were described in the same way. In some cases, coordinates on a map, or other resource, 
may be represented in degrees decimal minutes, such as 35° 22’ N, 119° 0’ W or 35° 
22.4’ N, 119° 1.066667’ W. Coordinates also may be presented in decimal degrees, such as 
35.3733333, -119.0177778. The coordinate system selected in the calculator must reflect 
the coordinate system used on the map or other resource.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>The Gosford Quad map uses the North American 1927 horizontal datum, 
so select "(NAD27) North American 1927" from the </span><span class="c1">Datum</span>
<span> drop-down list. In most cases you can find the datum printed on the bottom of 
the map. Sometimes an ellipsoid is listed on the map instead of a datum. The calculator 
also includes ellipsoids in the </span><span class="c1">Datum</span><span> drop-down 
list. If you find a resource such as a map with a datum that in not listed in the 
Calculator, try to find the ellipsoid for that datum using online resources, then select 
the ellipsoid in the </span><span class="c1">Datum</span><span> drop-down list.
</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>The coordinates in this example have been specified to the nearest 
second, so select "nearest second" from the </span>
<span class="c1">Coordinate Precision</span><span> drop-down list. The direction 
given in the locality description is E (east), so select “E” in the </span>
<span class="c1">Direction</span><span> drop-down list. The offset distance is 10 mi 
(miles), so type "10" into the </span><span class="c1">Offset Distance</span>
<span> text box.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Bakersfield is quite a big place and we don't know if the original 
locality meant 10 miles from the center of town or 10 miles from the city limit (or 
something else entirely), so, given that it is 3 miles from the specified coordinates to 
the east edge of town (as measured on the map), the </span><span class="c1">Extent of 
Named Place</span><span> should be 3 miles. Enter "3" into the </span>
<span class="c1">Extent of Named Place</span><span> text field.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span> If you had measured this distance 
in kilometers you can convert kilometers to miles using the </span>
<span class="c1">Distance Converter</span><span> at the bottom of the calculator and 
enter the converted number into the appropriate field (see the </span>
<span class="c1">Distance and Scale Converters</span><span> section to learn how to 
use the converters). </span><span class="c9">All distance measurements must be in the 
same system as the locality description for the calculator to return proper results</span>
<span>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>The determination of the coordinates for Bakersfield is only as 
accurate as the tools the georeferencer used; the map, the size of the units on the 
measurement tool, and the georeferencer’s ability to discern their placement relative to 
items on the map. Any error associated with the map itself is accounted for in the </span>
<span class="c1">Coordinate Source</span><span> selection. Error associated with the 
georeferencer’s ability to measure on the map is accounted for in the </span>
<span class="c1">Measurement Error</span><span> field.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To complete the </span><span class="c1">Measurement Error</span>
<span> field, you must first determine (or estimate) the smallest distance that you 
can reliably (repeatably) measure on the map. Generally, people can distinguish features 
or locations to within about one (1) millimeter, given a ruler with millimeter divisions. 
If you use a ruler with English units, you may be able to distinguish to 1/16 of an inch. 
The quality of your measuring tool, eyesight, and technique may alter these suggested 
values.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Once you have determined your smallest distance at which you can 
measure consistently and correctly, enter that value and the units into the </span>
<span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span> at the bottom of the calculator, 
select the scale of the map on which you made your measurement, and then select the unit 
of measure into which you want to convert. For example, if you used a digital measuring 
tool that was able to measure to the nearest 0.1 mm on a 1:24000 map and you need to 
convert to miles, enter 0.1 into the </span><span class="c1">Scale Converter</span>
<span>, then select “mm” from the units drop-down list. Next, choose the “1:24000” scale 
option in the map scale drop-down list. Finally, select “mi” in the second drop-down 
list. Your answer to 0.1 mm at 1:24000 converted into miles will be displayed in blue 
(0.00149 mi). You can then type “0.00149” into the </span><span class="c1">Measurement 
Error </span><span>field, or move it from the </span>
<span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span> using cut and paste keyboard 
combinations.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Next, make certain that "mi" is selected in the </span>
<span class="c1">Distance Units</span><span> drop-down list, since the locality is 
described in miles (“10 mi E...”). The distance component in this locality is 10 mi, 
which is precise to the nearest mile (see the discussion on this topic in the </span>
<span class="c1">Georeferencing Guidelines</span><span>). Select "1 mi" in the </span>
<span class="c1">Distance Precisio</span><span>n drop-down list. Now that all of the 
parameters for this locality have been entered, your calculator should appear as in 
Figure 5, below.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span>Figure 5. Calculator with all parameters entered for a “Distance at a

<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Next, click the </span><span class="c1">Calculate</span>
<span> button. The calculated coordinates (always presented in decimal degrees) for 
the locality ("10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield," in this example), and the </span>
<span class="c1">Maximum Error Distance</span><span> for the calculation will be 
given in the controls just above the distance and scale converters at the bottom of the 
calculator, as shown in Figure 6, below.</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>The results, in blue, can be highlighted and copied onto the system 
clipboard using standard copy and paste key combinations and transferred to a spreadsheet 
or database. The long text box underneath the new coordinates and maximum error contains 
a tab-delimited record of the data for the current calculation. These data can be copied 
all at once and pasted directly into a spreadsheet or database that has the same field 
order, which consists of the following terms: </span>
<span class="c9">decimalLatitude</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">decimalLongitude</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">coordinateUncertaintyInMeters</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">geodeticDatum</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">verbatimCoordinateSystem</span><span>, Extent, MaxErrorDistance, 
DistanceUnits, DistancePrecision, and CoordinatePrecision. The underlined terms are 
defined by the Darwin Core standard (</span><span class="c5">
<a class="c6" href="http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/">
http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/</a></span><span>). Note, CoordinatePrecision given by the 
calculation results is the precision of the input coordinates, not the precision of the 
final outcome, thus this is not the same as the Darwin Core term “coordinatePrecision”.
</span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span> Whenever you make a new selection 
on the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate System</span><span> drop-down list, the 
contents of the list will change to reflect the new system and the value in the </span>
<span class="c1">Coordinate Precision</span><span> drop-down list will be reset to 
"nearest degree." Be certain to set the value of the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate 
Precision</span><span> after changing the coordinate system.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To begin a new calculation, you can select a new calculation type 
and/or a new locality type from the appropriate</span><span class="c1"> </span>
<span>drop-down list or enter new data for all of the parameters necessary for your next 
calculation if it is the same calculation type and locality type. If the locality type is 
the same as for the previously georeferenced locality it is not necessary to select the 
locality type again. Values selected in the drop-down lists will remain selected until 
changed by the user, thus facilitating calculations for groups of localities having the 
same named place.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span class="c1">Calculating Errors only</span><span> </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To calculate the error for a locality for a locality with known 
coordinates, select “Error only” from the </span><span class="c1">Calculation Type</span>
<span> drop-down list. After selecting “Error only” a new </span>
<span class="c1">Locality Type</span><span> drop-down list box will appear on the 
screen. When this list is expanded, the calculator should appear as in Figure 7, below.</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Select the locality type that best matches the locality for which you 
are trying to determine the maximum error distance. The calculator is able to calculate 
the </span><span class="c1">Maximum Error Distance </span><span>(or </span>
<span class="c1">Maximum Uncertainty</span><span>) for all of the locality types

<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>After selecting a locality type, a number of controls will appear on 
the page. These controls allow you to enter or choose values for all of the parameters 
relevant to the selected locality type. Figure 8, below, shows an image of the 
Georeferencing Calculator after a locality type of "Distance only" was selected from 
the </span><span class="c1">Locality Type</span><span> drop-down list and the same

<p class="c7"><span>The results, in blue, can be highlighted and copied onto the system 
clipboard using standard copy and paste key combinations. Only those controls showing on 
the page when the Calculate Error button is clicked will figure into the error 
calculations.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span> Whenever you make a new selection 
on the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate System</span><span> drop-down list, 
the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate Precision</span><span> will reset to 
"nearest degree." Be sure to reset the </span><span class="c1">Coordinate Precision</span>
<span> after changing the coordinate system.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To begin a new calculation, you can select a new calculation type and 
a new locality type from the appropriate drop-down menus or enter new data for all of the 
parameters necessary for your next calculation. If the locality type is the same as for 
the previously georeferenced locality, it is not necessary to select the locality type 
again. Values selected in the drop-down lists will remain selected until changed by the 
user, thus facilitating error calculations for groups of localities having the same named 
place.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c1">Calculating Coordinates Only</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>At times it may be necessary to determine the coordinates before you 
can georeference the locality description itself. For, example, to georeference the 
locality "10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield," it is necessary to determine the coordinates for 
“Bakersfield” before the whole locality can be georeferenced. Suppose your coordinate 
source is the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map. Once you have determined the point on the 
map you believe to be the center of Bakersfield, find a convenient point on the map 
having known coordinates, such as the nearest corner of the map. In this case, the 
northeast corner of the map is closest and marked with the known coordinates 
35° 22” 30” N, 119° 00’ W.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To begin the calculation, select “Coordinates only” (because you only 
want to find the coordinates of the center of Bakersfield) as your </span>
<span class="c1">Calculation Type</span><span> and “Distance along orthogonal 
directions” as your </span><span class="c1">Locality Type</span><span> (because you 
are going to measure south and west from the corner of the map the the center of 
Bakersfield). Next, select “USGS map: 1:24,000” as your </span>
<span class="c1">Coordinate Source</span><span> and “degrees minutes seconds” as 
your </span><span class="c1">Coordinate System</span><span>. Enter the coordinates of the 
known point (the corner of the map, in this example) into the </span>
<span class="c1">Latitude</span><span> and </span><span class="c1">Longitude</span>
<span> fields (35° 22” 30” N, 119° 00’ W - don’t neglect the cardinal directions for 
the correct hemisphere). Finally, select “(NAD27) North American 1927” as your datum. 
When complete, the Calculator should appear as in Figure 9, below.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span>Figure 9. Calculator fields completed with known parameters for 
“Coordinates only” calculation type.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>Now use your measuring tool to measure a) the distance between the 
northeast corner of the map and the line of latitude of the center of Bakersfield where 
it meets the east edge of the map, and b) the distance between the northeast corner of 
the map and the line of longitude of the center of Bakersfield where it meets the north 
edge of the map. These are your orthogonal distances to the S and W of the known point, 
the northeast corner of the map.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span class="c1">NOTE:</span><span> You will have to convert the 
measurements you make on the maps (mm, cm, or inches) into the distance unit provided in 
the locality (miles, in this example). You can use the </span>
<span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span>, at the bottom of the Calculator, to do 
this calculation (see the section entitled </span>
<span class="c1">Distance and Scale Converters</span><span>). The accuracy of your 
measurements is determined by the size of the units marked on your measurement tool and 
your ability to discern their placement relative to items on the map, thus, final 
coordinates may vary depending upon the units you can measure. This uncertainty is 
addressed by the </span><span class="c1">Measurement Error</span><span> field in 
the “Coordinates and error” and “Error only” calculation types and will included in 
future steps in the georeferencing process.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>The point we have determined to be the center of Bakersfield is 
8 mm south of the 35° N line of latitude and 67 mm west of the 119° W line of 
longitude. After you have used the </span><span class="c1">Scale Converter</span>
<span> to convert millimeters to miles, cut and paste the values for miles into the 
Offset Distance boxes on the right side of the calculator: 0.1193 should be pasted or 
typed into the </span><span class="c1">North or South Offset Distance</span>
<span> field, and the cardinal direction drop-down list should be set to “S” 
(south); 0.99916 should be pasted or typed into the </span><span class="c1">East or West 
Offset Distance</span><span> field, and the cardinal direction drop-down list should 
be set to “W” (west). The </span><span class="c1">Distance Units</span>
<span> drop-down list should display “mi,” for miles, since that is the unit 
described in the locality. The calculator now has all of the parameters necessary to 
complete the calculation and should appear as in Figure 10, below.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span class="c1">Distance and Scale Converters</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>The Calculator has two converters built in to eliminate the need for 
additional resources during the georeferencing process; one for distance and one for 
scale. Both are located at the bottom of the Calculator and appear after a Calculation

<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To convert a distance from one unit to another, such as 10 miles to 
X kilometers, simply type “10” into the first field of the </span>
<span class="c1">Distance Converter</span><span>. Next, select “mi” from the left-hand 
drop-down list. To convert miles to kilometers, select “km” from the right-hand drop-down 
list. The result will automatically appear in the converter, in blue (16.09344 km, in 
this example), see Figure 14, below. To move this result to another field in the 
Calculator, use the cut and paste key combinations.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>When using a map and a measuring tool it is necessary to convert a 
distance measured on a map in units such as millimeters or inches into real world units 
(miles, kilometers) to complete the georeference for a specific locality. To 
georeference “10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield,” for example, all of the parameters entered 
into the Calculator (excluding the distance and scale converters) should be in miles.
</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c7"><span>To convert a map measurement of 8 centimeters into miles, using a map 
with a scale of 1:50000, simply type “8” into the first field of the </span>
<span class="c1">Scale Converter</span><span>. Next, select “cm” in the left-hand 
drop-down list, then select the map scale (“1:50000,” in this example) from the scale 
drop-down list. To convert centimeters to miles, select “mi” from the right-hand 
drop-down list. The result will automatically appear, in blue (2.48548 mi, in this 
example), see Figure 15, below. To move this result to another field in the Calculator, 
use the cut and paste key combinations.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span class="c1">Glossary</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Calculate </span><span>- Button used to 
calculate new coordinates, error, and other variables as a result of data entered into 
the Calculator. See the </span><span class="c1">Tab-delimited Calculation Result</span>
<span> glossary entry for a complete list.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Calculation Type </span><span>- Drop-down list 
from which one of the following three types of calculations can be selected:</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coordinates and Error </span><span>- Used to 
determine a set of coordinates and the associated error based on the parameters used in 
their determination, when the coordinates for a named place in a locality description are 
known.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coordinates Only </span><span>- Used to 
determine the coordinates for a named place in a locality description when distances to a 
set of known coordinates are measurable. Example: finding the coordinates of a named 
place based on the distances to coordinates labeled at the corner of a map.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Error Only </span><span>- Used to determine 
the error when the final coordinates for a locality description are already known. This 
is necessarily the case for the following Locality Types: Coordinates Only, Named Place 
Only, Distance Only, and Distance Along Path.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Coordinate Precision </span><span>- The 
category of precision with which a set of coordinates has been specified in their source. 
The set of possible values for precision is based on the coordinate system. A value of 
“exact” is any level of precision higher than the otherwise highest precision given on a 
list. Sources may include paper or digital maps, digital imagery, GPS’s, gazetteers, or 
locality descriptions. Examples: 35 22’ 24” = nearest second.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Coordinate Source </span><span>- The tool or 
other resources (map, GPS, gazetteer, locality description) from which the coordinates 
were derived.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Coordinate System </span><span>- Defines the 
original geographic coordinate system (decimal degrees, degrees minutes seconds, degrees 
decimal minutes) of the coordinate source. Selecting the original coordinate system 
allows the coordinates to be entered in their native format and forces the calculator to 
present appropriate values for coordinate precision.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Datum (Geodetic Datum) </span><span>- Defines 
the position of the origin and orientation of an ellipsoid upon which the coordinates are 
based for the given Coordinate Source. The Calculator includes ellipsoids on the 
drop-down list of Datums, as sometimes that is all that coordinate source shows. 
Examples: WGS84, NAD27</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ellipsoid </span><span>- The shape and size of 
a 3-dimensional model of the earth. The ellipsoid information is sufficient to do the 
types of calculations supported by the Georeferencing Calculator. Examples: Clarke 1866 
ellipsoid, International 1924 ellipsoid.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Decimal Latitude </span><span>- Presents the 
resulting latitude for a given calculation in decimal degrees. See, </span>
<span class="c1">Latitude</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Decimal Longitude </span><span>- Presents the 
resulting longitude for a given calculation in decimal degrees. See, </span>
<span class="c1">Longitude</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Direction </span>- The Calculator is 
designed to accommodate as many direction types as possible. It Includes abbreviations 
for all 32 points on the compass. You can read more about the directions and Boxing the 
Compass at </span><span class="c9 c10">
<a class="c6" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass</a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearest Degree </span><span>- When the 
“nearest degree” option is selected from the Direction drop-down list, an empty field 
appears in the Calculator to the right of the Direction drop-down list. Enter the heading 
(bearing; 0 is north, 90 is east, etc.) from the named place as given in the locality 
description. Example: “7 miles at 122° from mouth of Sacramento River” Note: if the 
bearing is given toward the named place instead of from it, enter the bearing 180 degrees 
away from the given bearing. Example: “1.5 km 262 degrees to Whale Rock,” for which you 
should enter “82” into the empty field.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Distance Converter </span><span>- A set of 
controls at the bottom of the Calculator comprising a tool designed to convert 
measurements from one unit of length into another. Example: 10 miles = 16.09344 
kilometers.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Distance Precision </span><span>- The 
precision with which a distance was measured and described reliably in a locality. 
Examples: select “1 mi” for "6 mi NE of Davis," select “1/10km” for “3.2 SE of Lisbon.”
</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Distance Units </span><span>- Used to set in 
the real world units used in the locality description. Use the original units as given in 
the description in order to configure the calculator to make the appropriate measurements 
and errors. Examples: select “mi” for "10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield," select “km” for 
“3.2 km SE of Lisbon.”</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Extent of Named Place </span><span>- The 
distance from the geographic center to the furthest point of the geographic area covered 
by a named place or feature. Types of named places include urban areas, small/mid-sized 
towns, remote locations, street addresses, junctions and crossings, and traditional and 
non-traditional features (lakes, mountains, cultural lands, reservations, parks, and 
other geographic entities).</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">GPS Accuracy </span><span>- When “GPS” is 
selected as the Coordinate Source, the label for the </span>
<span class="c1">Measurement Error</span><span> text box changes to “GPS Accuracy”. 
Enter the value given by the GPS at the time the coordinates were captured, or 30m for 
open areas after 1 May 2000 when Selective Availability was discontinued, or 100m in for 
other conditions.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Languages </span><span>- The Calculator may be 
used in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Dutch. The language can be changed using 
the language drop-down list in the upper left-hand corner of the Calculator. The English 
option has two variants with subtle differences. “English” will present the Calculator 
and all labels and formatting in English. “English (local)” will present the Calculator 
in the English language while retaining the Locale settings of the computer on which it 
is run. Thus, a computer configured for a French Locale will require and display numbers 
using commas as the decimal separator. Selecting “English” in the drop-down language list 
will force the calculator to use the period as the decimal separator. All other language 
selections not only change the language, but also change the number formatting to match.
</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Latitude </span><span>- The angle north or 
south of the equator (latitude 0). Latitudes north of the equator are positive by 
convention, while latitudes to the south are negative.The Calculator supports 
degree-based coordinate systems for latitude and longitude: degrees minutes seconds 
(35° 22’ 24” N), decimal degrees (35.3733333), and degrees decimal minutes (35° 22.4 N).
</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Locality Type </span><span>- The pattern of 
the most specific part of a locality description to be georeferenced. There are six 
variations that the Calculator can compute: Coordinates only, Distance along a path, 
Distance along orthogonal directions, Distance at a heading, Distance only, and Named 
place only. See </span><span class="c1">Extent of Named Place</span><span> for 
examples of named places.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Coordinates Only </span><span>- Examples: 
35° 22’ 24” N, 119° 1’ 4” W; 35.3733333, -119.0177778</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Distance Along A Path </span>
<span>- Example: 13 mi E of Bakersfield (State Highway 178) </span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Distance Along Orthogonal Directions </span>
<span>- Example: 2 mi E 3 mi N of Bakersfield</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Distance At A Heading </span><span>- Example: 
10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Distance Only </span><span>- Example: 5 mi 
from Bakersfield</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Named Place Only </span><span>- Examples: 
“Bakersfield,” “Lake Pontchartrain,” “Yosemite National Park”</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Longitude </span><span>- The angle east or 
west the prime meridian (longitude 0) - an arc between the north and south poles. 
Longitudes east of the prime meridian are positive by convention, while longitudes to the 
west are negative. The Calculator supports degree-based coordinate systems for latitude 
and longitude: degrees minutes seconds (35° 22’ 24” N), decimal degrees (35.3733333), and 
degrees decimal minutes (35° 22.4 N).</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Maximum Error Distance (coordinateUncertaintyInMeters) 
</span><span>- The combination of all sources of error (coordinate 
uncertainty, map scale, extent, GPS accuracy, measurement error, unknown datum, 
imprecision in direction measurements, and imprecision in distance measurements) in given 
calculation expressed as a linear distance, which can be thought of as a radius of a 
circle of uncertainty containing the entirety of the possible places a locality 
description could mean. </span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Measurement Error </span><span>- Accounts for 
error associated with the ability to distinguish one location from another using any 
measuring tools, such as rulers on paper maps.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Offset Distance </span><span>- The linear 
distance from a point of origin. Offset are used for localities that are measured by 
orthogonal directions (3 km N, 2 km E) or headings (N, SE, 262°).</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">North or South Offset Distance </span><span>- 
The distance of an orthogonal direction to the north or south of a known line of latitude.
</span></p>
<p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">East or West Offset Distance </span><span>- 
The distance of an orthogonal direction to the east or west of a known line of longitude.
</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Promote </span><span>- Button used to copy 
calculated coordinates from the “results” fields (Decimal Latitude, Decimal Longitude) 
into the Latitude and Longitude fields in preparation for a new calculation based on the 
previous results, eliminating the need to copy manually or to use cut and paste keyboard 
combinations. Used when the calculated coordinates represent the coordinates of a named 
place in locality description. Example: Using the “Coordinates only” calculation type, 
the coordinates for the named place “Tiny Town” are calculated. These coordinates, 
presented in the “results” fields, can be promoted up into the Latitude and Longitude 
fields to georeference the locality description “3 km SE Tiny Town” using the 
“Coordinates and error” calculation type.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Scale Converter </span><span>- A set of 
controls at the bottom of the Calculator comprising a tool designed to convert units of 
measure from a given map scale into units in real world distances. Example: 8 cm at a 
1:50000 map scale = 2.48548 miles.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tab-delimited Calculation Result </span>
<span>- The long field immediately under the Calculate and Promote buttons 
displays the complete set of values returned as a result of a calculation. Variables 
returned consist of of Darwin Core </span><span class="c5">
<a class="c6" href="">(http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/)</a></span><span> terms first 
(underlined) followed by other relevant data, in the following order: </span>
<span class="c9">decimalLatitude</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">decimalLongitude</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">coordinateUncertaintyInMeters</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">geodeticDatum</span><span>, </span>
<span class="c9">verbatimCoordinateSystem</span><span>, Extent, MaxErrorDistance, 
DistanceUnits, DistancePrecision, and CoordinatePrecision (this CoordinatePrecision is 
the precision of the input coordinates, not the final outcome, thus this is not the same 
as the Darwin Core term “coordinatePrecision”).</span></p>
<p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Version </span><span>- Displayed in the bottom 
left-hand corner of the Calculator as yyyymmdd(language). Example: 20110430en = English 
version created April 27, 2011. The changes from version to version are given in a change 
log file.</span></p>

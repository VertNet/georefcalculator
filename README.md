New generation Javascript-based VertNet Georeferencing Calculator


The properties.js file is encoded as ANSI for distribution in case the package is downloaded and run locally on Mac or PC. This is fine, but when installing the calculator on a unix system, the file should be re-encoded by doing the following:

iconv -f cp1252 -t utf8 properties.js --output propertiesutf8.js

then 

mv properties.js properties.orig.js
mv propertiesutf8.js properties.js
